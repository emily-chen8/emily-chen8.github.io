    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <h3> Second year</h3>
    <h3>Major: Data Science and Biochemistry</h3>
    <h4>Minor: Mathematics</h4>
    <p> Hi, my major stated above seems rather daunting (probably because it is) and the way I got to it is actually pretty simple. In high school I was a "science nerd" (and I was proud so it's ok). I performed research in lab setting essentially every summer and loved it. As I applied for colleges people said I should look into computer science at least as a minor and then I saw the combined major of data science and biochemistry and went for it. As for the math minor, I looked at my academic plan and saw the only math I was required to take was statistics and bioinformatics and I absolutely love math and calculus and could not even stand the thought of not taking it in college... I'd just miss it too much :)

    <h2>Main Extracurriculars </h2>
    <h3>Club Volleyball</h3>
    <p> I have been a setter/ defensive specialist on the club volleyball team since last fall (2019) and it has been pivotal in my success at Northeastern. It laid the foundation for my social life (as I made a lot of my closer friends now on the team) and it allowed me to manage my time so that I was able to go to practice/tournaments  (that were about 3-4 days a week) and still get all my work done. You can see more about the team -- the tournaments we're in, the roster, etc. -- on our <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/wclubvolleyball/">website</a>.

    <h3>NU Women in Technology</h3>
    <p> I am the PR Chair of this club also known as NU WIT and I think it somehow relates to this class. I send out weekly newsletters through mail chimp and I really enjoy laying out all the information I need to convey in an effective way that makes people want to read it and keep scrolling. I add humor in the text as well as graphics and buttons members can click to get the information. Some activities this club do are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>netowkring events</li>
        <li>workshops</li>
        <li>community events (i.e. movie night, welcome dinner)</li>
    </ul>
        <p> Check our <a href="https://nuwit.ccs.neu.edu/">website </a> for more information. 
    </p><h3>Big Sister Boston</h3>
    <p> Big Sister Boston is a community service club where I'm paired with an elementary schooler (I got paired with a third grader) from an underpriviledged school and every week I used to go to her school and eat lunch with her, do activities and provide a sort of mentorship role. It was and still is super fun and fulfilling; even though COVID-19 regulations do not permit me to visit her at school, we are penpals for the time being and I send her letters every week. </p>
    <h3>Pinto Lab</h3>
    <p> I work in a civil engineering lab (yes, I know combine that with my major and minor and I encompass essentially every aspect of STEM... I think it's cool :) ) that monitors chemical levels in tap water. </p>
